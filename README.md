## Overview 
While on vacation in Hawaii an idea blossoms to open an ice cream and surf shop.  W.Avy was contacted as a potential investor.  W. Avy is cautious but very interested in investing.  His main concern is the weather and if that's a good fit to open the shop in Oahu.  Previous experience resulted in a quickly closed surf shop due to the amount of rain and not so great weather.  In this Module weather data, inclusive of daily percipation and daily temperature, taken from local weather stations was used.  W. Avy was impressed with the initial presentation but wanted additional details on trends in the months of June and December in Oahu.  

## Results
Unlike the drastic weather change between June and December in Michigan, where temperatures can go from highs in the 90's to negative in December, Oahu seems like a dream.  There is not much difference between the summary statistics between the month of June and December. 
- The average temperature in June is 74.9 degrees while in December it is 71 degrees, only a 4 degree difference.
- The max temperature in June is 85 while in December it is 83, just a two degree difference. 
- The number of readings is about 200 less in December than what is taken in June.
- The largest statistical difference is the minimum temperature.  In June it is 64 while in December it can go down to 56 (assuming that this is at night and not during the day)

## Summary
Overall, Oahu seems to be a magical place to open up a ice cream and surf shop.  The temperature seems to be just right to eat ice cream and take a ride on a surf board in the ocean.  
Some additional queries that could compliment what has already been done is to look at percipation during those months.  I can't say that rain will stop someone from eating ice cream or surfing, but it could deter a novice surfer.  Also, the statistics are coming from all of the stations.  One could look more closely at station summary statisitcs to better pin point where the shop should go.  Perhaps one side of the island is warmer or less rain.  Other queries that could be looked at that is not included in this data set is the number of sunny days, the number of tourists, crime data etc.
